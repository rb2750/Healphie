This is a flutter app designed to help with tracking mental health over time. This can be used to determine if therapy or anxiety beta blockers etc are working.

You get a reminder notification every hour to remind you to update how you're feeling in the app.

## Charts
After there is enough data the graphs will start to come in use, with the bar charts giving times up to the minute of how you felt on that day.

All the charts have viewing options of day, month and year.

There is also a pie chart which allows you to see what you're feeling a majority of the time.
